bash# modprobe g_mass_storage file=/root/data/backing_file

Creating a backing storage file
bash# dd bs=1M count=64 if=/dev/zero of=/root/data/backing_file

Partitioning the backing storage
bash# fdisk /root/data/backing_file

Creat a new FAT32 patition
$fdisk backing_file
$p
$defalt
$defalt
$w
$mkfs.fat -F 32 backing_file

To summarize it all, the architecture we want to implement will be as follows:
1.The Linux Mass Storage Gadget will be used to implement a USB storage device accessible by host software.
2.To ensure that the USB storage content survives power-cycles and resets, the backing file will be in Flash.
3.To allow upper-level software accessing the backing file transparently and avoid a Flash wear, the backing file will be a normal file in a JFFS2 file system.
4.The JFFS2 file system will be mounted on a dedicated partition in the NOR Flash.
5.The backing file will be mounted as a FAT32 file system on both the Linux and host PC sides. On the Linux side, the backing file will be mounted as a FAT2 file system using the "loop" block device.


NOTE: The hardware DOES NOT support isochronous transfers it however supports interrupt, bulk and control transfers.

the Pilot4 Hub framework supports only high speed Hub and devices behind it should be High speed only.

The Mass storage UDC uses interrupt number 67


Information to build and use the Pilot4 Mass storage UDC and Pilot4 Mass storage gadget
 Enable the following to be built as modules
Device Drivers -> USB support ->USB Gadget Support -> pilot4 standalone mass storage device support
Device Drivers -> USB support ->USB Gadget Support -> Mass Storage Gadget
 Once the kernel and modules are built, the UDC driver and the gadget drivers are created with “pilot4_mass_storage_udc.ko” and “g_mass_storage.ko”
 On the pilot4 orion card the UDC diver should be insmod’d first like this “insmod pilot4_mass_storage_udc.ko”
 The Mass storage gadget exposes a backing file as a mass storage device, the backing file can be created like this on the Pilot4 orion card “dd bs=1M count=8 if=/dev/zero of=/big_backing_file1”
 Now insmod the gadget driver like this “insmod g_mass_storage.ko file=/big_backing_file1 removable=1”
 This should show up a mass storage device on the Host system
